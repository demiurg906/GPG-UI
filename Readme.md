# GPG UI

This simple app provides simple UI for working with messages encrypted with PGP protocol. It allows to decrypt, encrypt and sign messages, and provides simple abilities for managing your public keys

This app does not store anything, don't send your data to the cloud and simply uses `gpg` under the hood

Supported platform is Linux (I didn't checked on other platforms)
